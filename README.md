# Story
Our project, the Automated Chess Board, is designed to provide chess players with the experience of playing against a computer while maintaining the traditional charm of playing on a physical board. Players make their moves on the physical board, and the computer recognizes and responds to these moves. Additionally, we have a mode where two AI opponents can play against each other. It was a self-guided project done in collaboration with 4 other students and supervised by Prof. Christoph Koch.

# What
A chessboard that allows players to play against a computer.
The computer recognizes and responds to moves made by players on the physical board.
# How
We used the following components and supplies to build the Automated Chess Board:

Arduino UNO
Raspberry Pi 3
ESP32 CAM
Two Stepper Motors
Electromagnet
3D Printed Chess Pieces (see .stl files for details)
Linear Bearings

# Challenges
The key challenges in building this project included designing and constructing the automated chessboard, integrating the electronic components, and creating the necessary software for communication between the physical board and the computer.

# Result
The result is a fully functional Automated Chess Board that allows players to enjoy a traditional chess experience while playing against a computer opponent. The electromagnet under the board moves the chess pieces, and the computer manages the game.
